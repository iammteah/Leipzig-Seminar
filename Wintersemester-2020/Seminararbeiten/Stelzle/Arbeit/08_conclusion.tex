\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper implemented a suggestion for an ontology for Functional Analysis.
Most of the information were taken from the book "Systematische  Innovationsmethoden" and the talk from Nikolai Shchedrin. 
This gives a good summary over all the concepts which are need for a Functional Model and the Functional Analysis. 
In a next step other sources could be added and the ontology could be advanced.

Furthermore the examples could be made more specific, which would help for a greater understanding on the topic. 
An interesting aspect would also to see multiple approaches on how to optimize a function with different principles.

As there is another update of the Matrix another implementation for this would also be helpful.

In conclusion this implementation should give a good starting point for the ontology for Functional Analysis, but could be advanced with more knowledge and ideas from other sources.
