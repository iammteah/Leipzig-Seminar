\section{Aim of the work}

The aim of this paper is to elaborate a proposal for an ontological modelling
of the areas of \emph{TRIZ Functional Analysis} based on the approaches
in \cite{KS}, \cite{WebinarFunctionAnalysis}, \cite{SouchkovGlossary} and further own investigations.
The work fits into the activities of the \emph{WUMM Ontology Project}
\cite{WUMM} to model core TRIZ concepts using modern semantic web means.  The
work consists of two parts -- a \emph{turtle file}, in which the semantic
modelling is performed based on the SKOS framework \cite{SKOS}, and \emph{this
  elaboration}, in which the backgrounds and motivations of the concrete
modelling decisions are detailed.

The paper is structured in the following way. 
In section \ref{sec:starting_point} the information sources are mentioned and further explained.
In the following section the conceptualisation will be shortly explained.
In section \ref{sec:functional_analysis} the Functional Analysis as described in \cite{KS} will be summarized.
The next section introduces Python tools which have been implemented to make the \textit{turtle}-file creation easier.
Following it will be shown how and why the \textit{turtle}-file has been created in that way.
In extension to the last section will be some example implementations of the \textit{turtle}-file for Functional Analysis in section \ref{sec:examples}.
In the last section a conclusion about the paper is given.
