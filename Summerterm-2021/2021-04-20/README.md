## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  System Management, Organizations, Systems. Basic Notions
* __Presenter:__ Hans-Gert Gräbe


## Abstract

The handout focuses on first clarifying the basic terms "systematic
management", "organisation" and "system". I will dwell longer on the
conceptual developments in (Sommerville 2015, Ch. 13). 

Product quality essentially depends on the quality of internal processes and
thus ultimately on management quality (in a variation of a Latin saying: Only
a healthy company produces healthy products). This is a central conviction of
systematic management theories.

Being the starting point of "Systematic Management", ISO 9000 and the CMMI
maturity model emphasise the importance of systematically building and
expanding the structural and material basis of management decisions over the
outstanding mental and organisational skills of individual managers.
