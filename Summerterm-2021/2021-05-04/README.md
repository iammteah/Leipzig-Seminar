## From the Chat

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- Reward = Incentive (is this the same). Incentives for what? Given goals are
  not questioned.  Who is the subject that sets incentives?

- Shchedrovitsky: "Organisations do not have goals, only people have goals" -
  stresses "Living organisation" is in motion, i.e. its goals are evolving
  too?

- Bonus - wage supplement, but unlike wages, this is agreed _afterwards_ and not
  _in beforehand_.

- Material incentives (company own cafeteria, kindergarden) - infrastructure
  benefits. How is infrastructure financed?

- Cultural incentives (good climate, nice colleagues) - also infrastructure,
  but different from material incentives. Both _emergent_ properties of the
  whole organization.

- Incentive as a means of control and management. Distinguish subject (the
  controller) and object (the controlled)?  Does Shchedrovitsky's distinction
  between leadership and management play a role here?

- How does payment for labour work? Marx: "Average necessary labour",
  i.e. "money against time", but time is a complicated notion here.

- pay ratio: How is this difference in "hourly rates" to be understood
  theoretically? It is not only a problem between "manager" and "worker", but
  also with (highly paid) "experts".

- Geneva scheme - how is this related to the role concept? Role is separation
  of requirements and private skills, which management has to bring together
  "just in time" in the production workflow.  "Skill" and "Load capacity" are
  two aspects, but concrete role concepts are much more detailed.

- Overview by Christian Scholz (slide 15) - can this be taken seriously?
  Hasn't every generation gone through the phases Z - Y - X - 0?

- Daniel Werner : Shchedrovitsky: "Organisations don't have goals, only people
  have goals" -> it is quite normal for the working population to see the
  management level as a closed organisation, although it is of course made up
  of people.

- Jannis de Riz : you just have to define "good".

- Jannis de Riz : bonuses are variable salaries I would say.  And therefore
  more incentive than a fixed salary, which is paid in advance.

- Marie Windhorst : but a lot of things have already been shifted backwards,
  which is more in the time of the start of work.

- Kleemann : system and system: in the sense of order this is systematic - in
  the sense of system this is a construction kit of elements and not of
  elements in a relation ordered in itself

- Kleemann : role as an access for relationing the elements

- Kleemann : which identification and sense of justice as ideas of belonging,
  so crucial how management not only applies methods but sees and executes
  production in corporate identety design

- Kleemann : ---def: throughput of system
