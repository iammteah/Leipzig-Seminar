## Abstract

First, continuing the explanations in last seminar, dimensions of a systemic
approach will be explored in more detail.

Then the conceptual field of "organisation, management, leadership" according
to G.P. Shchedrovitsky (see [MSM: p. 26 ff.]) will be briefly introduced.

Finally, on this basis, tasks and forms of movement of a systematic management
within organisations will be considered. A central result is that management
means to _control the processes_ taking place in the (living) organisation
with the _goal_ to implement the _purposes_ of the organisation in an
efficient way.

To this end, we first look at the control loop of the ISO 9000 process model.
ISO 9000 is a standard for the _evaluation_ of process quality, the process
model specified there is thus a reference for good process organisation within
a company.

Process models in their development dimension are then discussed using the
example of CMM(I) as a _maturity model for organisational development_ in the
software sector.
