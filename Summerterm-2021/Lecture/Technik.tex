\section{Background}
\begin{frame}{What is Technology?}

Technology in the sense of the \textbf{VDI Guideline 3780} comprises:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the set of use-oriented, artificial, representational structures
  (artefacts or material systems),
\item[-] the set of human actions and facilities in which material systems
  (Sachsysteme) are created and
\item[-] the set of human actions in which material systems are used.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology assessment} thus refers not only to material real-world
systems, but also to the conditions and consequences of their creation and
use.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of Technology -- Purpose and Objective}

The \textbf{target group} of the VDI Guideline 3780 is all those responsible
and affected in science, society and politics, who are involved in decisions
about involved in decisions on technical developments and in shaping the
corresponding socio-cultural framework conditions, in particular engineers,
scientists, planners and managers who design and evaluate new technical
developments.

The \textbf{purpose} of the guideline is to provide all those involved with a
common understanding of terms, methods and value ranges. The guideline is
intended to systematically analyse objectives, values and alternatives to make
well-founded decisions. ...

Technology as a status symbol

But: You find there also detailed description of the technical parameters and
the history.  history.

... In the meantime, statistics show that most of military combats take place
at distances of less than 400 m, even less than 200 m in urban areas. In the
case of police operations, the distances are usually even shorter.  At the
same time, the shooter is no longer in the open field, but often fights from
vehicles or inside buildings, where only compact weapons offer sufficient room
for movement. ...

\begin{frame}{What else is Technology?}

- Painting techniques, writing techniques

- Flower arranging techniques

- Political techniques, power techniques

=> Practice, experience, skill

Different variants of a machine-centred and an action-centred understanding of
technology compete with each other.

\begin{frame}{More on the Concept of Technology}

1) The concept of technology for products of technically supported action,
i.e. for individual machines or, more comprehensively, for the entire existing
system of material means to transform nature for human purposes.

2) An action-oriented concept of technology ... ties in with the Greek concept
of techné as procedural knowledge that guides people in the in the production
of things ... and thus enables a technical knowledge that controls nature in
both a reproductive and a manipulative sense. (Source: H. Petzold, Dictionary
of Philosophy)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Technology and Language}

Technique is something that obeys to the word.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Technique and Forms of Description}

- Technology as "condensed description"

- Essential form in which human agreements manifest theirself

- Technology as a social phenomenon of humanity

- Technology as an intersubjective phenomenon

- Essential intersubjective dimensions: Descriptions and execution of action

In the following we will understand technology as an interrelation of

Socially available procedural knowledge,

institutionalised procedures ("state of the art") and

Private procedural skills.
