## Issues in the theory of dynamical systems

## First examples

Examples in the homogeneous gravitational field

- The Pendulum
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendel>
- Coupled Pendulum
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation#Coupled_oscillations>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekoppelte_Pendel>
- Double pendulum and chaotic trajectories, deterministic chaos
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelpendel>
- Magnetic Pendulum
  - <https://www.supermagnete.de/eng/Magnet-applications/Magnetic-pendulum>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetisches_Pendel>

Examples with gravitational interaction
- Two-body problem
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zweikörperproblem>
- Three-body problem
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreikörperproblem>
- KAM theory (Kolmogorow-Arnold-Moser-Theorem)

  - ... Quasiperiodic solutions can be close to each other, but unstable
    orbits can lie between them, so that in practice it cannot be decided
    whether one is on a stable or unstable orbit because of, for example,
    finite measurement accuracy. For the planetary system, it can be shown
    that the unstable orbits are much rarer than the stable ones.

These are already - necessarily reductionistic - description forms of reality:
for example, pendulums with and without damping.  But: Meaningful reductions
of forms of description __improve__ our understanding of the
interrelationships of the world.  If Galileo Galilei had not applied this
method of thinking he would never have noticed that iron and feather fall at
the same rate.

- Not everything that looks like chaos has to be chaotic:

## Limit cycles and attractors

- Limit cycles
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenzzyklus>
- Attractor = stable solution of the corresponding system of diff. eq.
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor>

Example: Attractors of the magnetic pendulum were the three stable end
positions, i.e. three points in the phase space.

- Hysteresis
  - Example: Temperature control of a heating system
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterese>
- Predator-prey cycles
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Räuber-Beute-Beziehung>
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka-Volterra-Regeln>

On the importance of "stable" cyclical processes in nature. 

We are able to perceive such __approximately__ repeating patterns in natural
processes (i.e. attractors), i.e. also independently of mathematics achieve
such a reduction performance.

- Question: How complicated can such attractors become?
- The Lorenz attractor
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz-Attraktor>
  - Attention, with the numerical methods used there for visualisation it is
    difficult to distinguish whether they are calculating a chaotic trajectory
    or really the attractor, which is a __global__ artefact.
  - "Almost all initial points will tend to an invariant set – the Lorenz
    attractor – a strange attractor, a fractal, and a self-excited attractor"
    (Wikipedia)

- Strange (or chaotic) Attractors
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor>
  - <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seltsamer_Attraktor>

  - "final state of a dynamic process whose fractal dimension is non-integer
    and whose Kolmogorov entropy is genuinely positive. It is a fractal that
    cannot be described geometrically in closed form". (German Wikipedia)

  - A dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally
    stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points
    diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor.

__This means that the trajectory concept of classical physics is no longer
applicable to such phenomena__.  ("butterfly effect").

## Systems on multiple time scales

An important approach arises for systems whose dynamics run on different time
scales. As a further step of abstraction, one can then methodically first
investigate the dynamics on the individual time scales and later add the
interactions between the time scales in an extended model.  Massively new
phenomena arise already when considering __two__ time scales, which is
referred to as __micro- and macroevolution__. 

- Example: double pendulum with two very different length (and small
  deflection).
  - Hence eigenfrequencies are different, but the "upper" pendulum "injects"
    energy at different rates to the "lower" pendulum to force it in a
    "common" movement.
  - Although a double pendulum, the system is thus (finally) _not_ chaotic,
    but behaves like a simple pendulum with mass at the centre of gravity.
  
- Known in the literature as the "enslavement effect" and used especially in
  methodologically poorly founded sociological considerations as a verbal
  argument.

- But see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netzwerkforschung

What problems arise in piecing together (understood) microevolutions of
subsystems to an understanding of macro-level dynamics?

## Emergent phenomena

"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts".  This __only__ applies to the
submersive system concept.
